# Keras-ML-GCN

To create a combine_word vector, we use comb_embding.py
To train our model by using Keras, we create data_generator.py
To get final ad_maritx, we use get_final_maritx.py
To train our model, we use train.py


To train our model, we should put the train data into the ./train folder and put the word vectors into the ./word_embding folder.
To train your model, we propose the format is the same as that in the file.
